# modulizer
C++20 modularizer, convert #include code into using C++ module

# Base requirements
- Valid standard C++20
- Macros in one file don't affect the content of another, except for include guards which will be specially handled if applicable.

# Other requirements generated by implementation details (compromises)
- In static function/variable declarations, ```static``` must be the first specifier (eg. ```static int x;```)
- Angle-bracket includes (```#include <...>```) aren't considered in include to import conversion because by convention it is for system headers. Vice versa for quote includes (```#include "..."```)
