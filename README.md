# modulizer
C++20 modularizer, convert #include code into using C++ module

# Base requirements
- Valid standard C++20
- Macros in one file don't affect the content of another, except for include guards which will be specially handled if applicable.

# Other assumptions generated by implementation details (compromises)
- In static function/variable declarations, ```static``` must be the first specifier (eg. ```static int x;```)
